# Enhancing Automated Vein Cannulation: Algorithms for Improved Accuracy and Efficiency

This project focuses on overcoming two main challenges in implementing an automated vein cannulation system: 
1. Hair obscuring vein visibility and enhancing vein detection in grayscale NIR images. 
2. Enhancing the visibility of the veins in the grayscale images.

## Algorithms

To address these challenges, we propose a hair removal algorithm and a vein enhancement algorithm to improve the visibility of veins by removing hair and contrast the veins w.r.t the background respectively.
